# Checking file and directory details
The following codes demonstrate how I used the Linux commands to show the set of permissions of files within the projects directory in the file system.

The first line of screenshot is the command that I entered, other lines are the outputs. I used `ls` command with `-la` options to show all of the file contents even hidden files. There is one directory named `drafts`, one hidden file named `.project_x.txt.` There are also five other project files. The 10-character string at the beginning of lines is appropriate permissions of files or directories (except the first one. Because the first character of 10-character string is related to the type of files. `d` means that it is a directory, and `-` represents a regular file).
